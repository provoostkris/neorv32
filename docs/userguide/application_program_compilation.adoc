== Application Program Compilation

This guide shows how to compile an example C-code application into a NEORV32 executable that
can be uploaded via the bootloader or the on-chip debugger.

[start=1]
. Open a terminal console and navigate to one of the project's example programs. For instance, navigate to the
simple `sw/example_demo_blink_led` example program. This program uses the NEORV32 GPIO module to display
an 8-bit counter on the lowest eight bit of the `gpio_o` output port.
. To compile the project and generate an executable simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
neorv32/sw/example/demo_blink_led$ make clean_all exe
----

[start=3]
. The `clean_all` target is used (instead of just `clean`) to ensure everything is re-build.
. The `exe` target will compile and link the application sources together with all the included libraries.
At the end an ELF file (`main.elf`) is generated. The _NEORV32 image generator_ (in `sw/image_gen`)
takes this file and creates the final executable (`neorv32_exe.bin`). The makefile will show the resulting
memory utilization and the executable size:

[source,bash]
----
neorv32/sw/example/demo_blink_led$ make clean_all exe
Memory utilization:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   1004       0       0    1004     3ec main.elf
Compiling ../../../sw/image_gen/image_gen
Executable (neorv32_exe.bin) size in bytes:
1016
----

.Build Artifacts
[NOTE]
All _intermediate_ build artifacts (like object files and binaries) will be places into a (new) project-local
folder named `build`. The _resulting_ build artifacts (like executable, the main ELF and all memory
initialization/image files) will be placed in the root project folder.

[start=5]
. That's it. The `exe` target has created the actual executable `neorv32_exe.bin` in the current folder
that is ready to be uploaded to the processor using the build-in bootloader. Alternatively, the ELF file can
be uploaded using the on-chip debugger.
