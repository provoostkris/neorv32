== RISC-V Architecture Test Framework

The NEORV32 Processor passes the according tests provided by the official RISC-V Architecture Test Suite
(V2.0+), which is available online at GitHub: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-arch-test

All files required for executing the test framework on a simulated instance of the processor (including port
files) are located in the `sw/isa-test` folder of the NEORV32 repository. The test framework is executed via the
`sim/run_riscv_arch_test.sh` script. Take a look at the provided `sim/README.md`
(https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/master/sim[online at GitHub])
file for more information on how to run the tests and how testing is conducted in detail.
