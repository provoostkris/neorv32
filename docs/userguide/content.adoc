Let's Get It Started!

This user guide uses the NEORV32 project _as is_ from the official `neorv32` repository.
To make your first NEORV32 project run, follow the guides from the upcoming sections. It is recommended to
follow these guides step by step and eventually in the presented order.

[TIP]
This guide uses the minimalistic and platform/toolchain agnostic SoC test setups from
`rtl/test_setups` for illustration. You can use one of the provided test setups for
your first FPGA tests. Alternatively, have a look at the `setups` folder,
which provides more sophisticated example setups for various FPGAs/FPGA boards and toolchains.
