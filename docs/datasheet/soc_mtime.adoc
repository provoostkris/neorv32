|=======================

The MTIME module implements the memory-mapped MTIME machine timer from the official RISC-V
specifications. This module features a 64-bit system timer incrementing with the primary processor clock.
Besides accessing the MTIME register via memory operation the current system time can also be obtained using
the `time[h]` CSRs. Furthermore, the current system time is made available for processor-external
usage via the top's `mtime_o` signal.

The 64-bit system time can be accessed via the `TIME_LO` and `TIME_HI` memory-mapped registers (read/write) and also via
the CPU's `time[h]` CSRs (read-only). A 64-bit time compare register - accessible via the memory-mapped `TIMECMP_LO` and `TIMECMP_HI`
registers - is used to configure the CPU's MTI (machine timer interrupt). The interrupt is triggered
whenever `TIME` (high & low part) is greater than or equal to `TIMECMP` (high & low part).
The interrupt remain active (=pending) until `TIME` becomes less `TIMECMP` again (either by modifying `TIME` or `TIMECMP`).

.Reset
[NOTE]
After a hardware reset the `TIME` register is reset to **all-zero** and the `TIMECMP` register is reset to **all-one**
to prevent accidental interrupt requests during early boot phase.

.External MTIME Input
[NOTE]
If the processor-internal **MTIME module is NOT implemented**, the top's `mtime_i` input signal is used to update the `time[h]` CSRs
and the `MTI` machine timer CPU interrupt (`MTI`) is directly connected to the top's `mtime_irq_i` input. The `mtime_o` signal
is hardwired to zero in this case.

.External MTIME Interrupt
[IMPORTANT]
The `mtime_irq_i` signal is level-triggered and high-active. Once set the signal has to stay high until
the interrupt request is explicitly acknowledged (e.g. writing to a memory-mapped register). All RISC-V standard interrupts
can **NOT** be acknowledged by writing zero to the according <<_mip>> CSR bit. +
